# hugo-contact

This is a small, self-hosted Go application that acts as a (mostly) drop-in replacement for services like Formspree or Airform. It accepts form submissions from static sites (like Hugo) and sends them to a configured SMTP endpoint.

## Features

- Formspree-compatible POST endpoint (`/f/contact`)
- Honeypot spam protection
- CORS support
- Structured JSON logging using Go's `slog` package
- Environment-configurable SMTP (Zoho, Gmail, Mailgun, etc.)
- Optional redirect with `_next` field
- Lightweight and Docker-ready
- No external dependencies beyond Go's standard library
- A small, self-contained JavaScript script (required) to prevent spam-bots

## Example HTML Form

Note that the script needs to be *only* on the pages that have forms and not loaded on the entire site, and should be loaded after the form. 
This script will load a signed timestamp-based token that will need to be included in the form that needs to be included in the submission. 
It expires in 15 minutes. This could create some false positives, for example, if a visitor went to the site and took more than 15 minutes to make their comment.  
The time range can be adjusted in the code, or you could warn them on the page that the form expires in 15 minutes. 
It also doesn't allow it to be posted within 2 seconds, as that will most likely be a bot.   

```html
<form action="https://contact.yourdomain.com/f/contact" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" required>
  <textarea name="message" required></textarea>
  <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none">
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
<script>
    const s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://contact.yourdomain.com/form-token.js';
    s.defer = true;
    document.body.appendChild(s);
</script>
```

This will load the form, then load the script. The script will append the signed token to the form to include it with the submission.
